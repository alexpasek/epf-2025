        "Why remove popcorn ceilings now?. If you're in Leslieville or anywhere in Toronto, textured ceilings drag down natural light and resale value. We remove the texture, skim to Level 5, and deliver the bright ceilings buyers expect.",
        "Prep that protects your home. Before scraping, our crews seal rooms, protect floors and vents, and test for painted texture. This keeps dust out of lived-in spaces and speeds up the cleanup.",
        "Cleanup timelines. Most living rooms finish in 1–2 days, including removal, skim, sanding, and primer. Condo projects can be phased to keep elevators clear and schedules on track.",
        "Pricing factors. Square footage, ceiling height, painted texture, and lighting upgrades affect the quote. We send a same-day range from photos and confirm on site before work begins.",
        "Turnkey upgrades: baseboards & paint. After smoothing ceilings we can install new baseboards or paint the entire room so your popcorn removal feels like a full refresh.",
        "Ready for a smooth ceiling?. Send photos for a same-day popcorn removal quote or book an on-site visit. We cover Toronto, Mississauga, Oakville, Burlington, Milton, and Hamilton."
